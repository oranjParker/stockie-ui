Dividing a large project into smaller, manageable parts is a great approach to software development. This not only makes the development process more manageable but also allows for better testing, troubleshooting, and potential for team collaboration. Here's how you could split the project:

User Authentication: Start by setting up the basic user registration and login functionality. Use Django's built-in User model and authentication system. Make sure to include email verification during the registration process and password reset functionality.

User Profiles: Once you have user registration and login working, add the functionality for users to view and edit their own profiles. This could include changing their password, email, username, and adding an avatar.

Upload Media: Develop the functionality for users to upload media. Depending on your needs, you could start with images since they're the simplest. Make sure to handle file validation and consider how you're going to handle storage (you might need to use a service like Amazon S3 if you expect a lot of large files).

Search and Browse Media: Once media uploading is implemented, add the functionality to browse uploaded media. This could be as simple as a page that displays all media. Add a search functionality for users to find specific media.

Media Details: Develop a media detail view where users can see more information about a piece of media (like its title, description, and uploader).

Likes and Collections: Implement the functionality for users to "like" a media post and to add media posts to their collections. You'll need to modify the User and MediaPost models to keep track of this information.

Payment System: Implement the payment system that allows users to donate or pay for media posts. This could be a complex task depending on your needs and will likely involve integrating with a third-party service like Stripe or PayPal.

Social Media Sharing: Add the functionality for users to share media posts on social media. This could involve integrating with various social media APIs.

Third-party Authentication: Implement sign in via Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Apple.

Each of these parts can be developed, tested, and debugged separately. Once all parts are done and integrated, you can then focus on refining the user interface, performance optimization, and any other additional features. Remember, iterative development is all about making a small part work perfectly and then building on top of it. This way, you always have something that works.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
